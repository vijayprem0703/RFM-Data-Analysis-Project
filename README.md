# RFM Analysis Project
RFM analysis using Python - SQL and visualization with Power BI

## Problem Description

Businesses generate large amounts of transactional data, but turning that raw data into actionable customer insights remains a challenge. Without structured analysis, organizations cannot:

* Identify which customers are the most loyal and profitable.

* Detect customers who are at risk of churning.

* Personalize marketing campaigns based on customer behavior.

* Allocate resources effectively across different customer groups.

## Project Goals

* Perform RFM Analysis to evaluate customer behavior based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.

* Segment customers into groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Hibernating, Promising, etc.

* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and help businesses make data-driven decisions.
*

## Future Steps

* Automate data pipeline (ETL) for real-time customer insights.

* Integrate predictive modeling (e.g., churn prediction, customer lifetime value).

* Expand segmentation criteria with demographics and behavioral data.

* Deploy dashboard in a cloud environment for wider accessibility.

## Conclusion

The RFM-based segmentation successfully highlights customer groups and their purchase patterns. The dashboard provides clear visibility into customer loyalty, purchase frequency, and spending habits. These insights enable targeted marketing strategies, customer retention plans, and better decision-making.
